# Predict winners of FIFA World Cup 2018

The aim of this sprint was to build a model that will be able to predict the FIFA World Cup 2018 winner.<br>
Before the start of the World Cup Germany and Brazil were the clear favourites, with many models predicting Germany.

I am not much of a sports fan, even though i do partake in sports, but football has never interested me much.<br>
I approached this project with a basic understanding of football but no knowledge of current players and the ranks of teams nor their current performance.

I read up on many of the teams before they played even researching the odds and "expert" opinions on various sports sites.

The model had to be be completed by the knockout stages with our winning  probabilities on the remaining eight teams that we predicted going forward.
